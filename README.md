This is another test!

For my project I will be using a queue to implement my own music library database, much like the digital music service Spotify. My program will be user-centered and will prompt the user to choose to do certain things with songs, such as play, add to up next, add to a playlist, search for a song, etc. The queue will be the main data structure of focus but there will also be arrays and linked lists implemented in the code. A menu will be displayed with options and when the user selects 1 of the options from the menu, they will be executed by a method found in the source file.
